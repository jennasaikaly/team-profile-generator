  ## Description

  This is the challenge for Module 10 (Object-Oriented Programming).  We are tasked with creating a Profile Generator that the user will complete by answering command-line prompts.  I used Node.js, Inquirer and Jest for this Challenge.

  ## Installation

  To install, the user will have to clone this repo and install the dependencies.  They can then run the application by typing 'node index.js' or 'node index' in the command line of the terminal.

  ## Usage 

  Once the user runs the application, they will be prompted to create a profile for the Manager.  Then, they will have options to either create a profile for an Engineer, an Intern, or to finish.  Once they finish, the application will create an HTML file that will display the different Employee profiles that were created.
